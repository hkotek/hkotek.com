If you’re wondering how to pronounce my name: in IPA, my first name is [hə.'das] and my last name is ['ko.tɛk]. [Hadas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadass) is a Israeli/Jewish name referring to one of the Four species, and it is also related to the biblical name [Hadassah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther). Kotek is a Czech name meaning "kitten," and it has cognates in pretty much every Slavic language I know of. Most English-speakers will pronounce my last name with a dipthong, and that is fine with me - I often pronounce it like that myself these days. As for my first name, the only important thing to remember is the stress. You can get rid of the first syllable altogether and I'll still recognize what you say as my name, but if you stress the first syllable there's a good chance that won't even realize that you're talking to me. 

[Here](AvodatGmar.pdf) is a research paper I wrote about my grandfather's journey during World War II: from Czechoslovakia to Denmark to Sweden to England back to mainland Europe, and after the war: from Slovakia to Austria to France to Israel (in Hebrew; contains original interviews with 10 individuals who were also members of my grandfather's Youth Aliyah group, who had similar stories).
