[Questions, focus, and
friends](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~michael.erlewine/focus-wh/):
Research seminar at McGill, about questions and answers to questions. The seminar focuses on the syntactic mechanism of (overt and covert) movement and the semantic mechanism of focus alternatives computation as means of scope taking in natural language, focusing in particular on constituent questions and association with focus from a cross-linguistic perspective.


[Turkshop](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/): 
Workshop at the Experimental Syntax/Semantics lab at MIT department of Linguistics on the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, introducing [turktools](turktools.net): a set of tools designed to assist researchers to create a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. The tools further help streamline the design of such linguistic experiment and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.

In the winter of 2015 I'll teach a special topics undergraduate seminar at McGill University, topic TBD.
