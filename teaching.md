friends](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~michael.erlewine/focus-wh/):
Research seminar at McGill, about questions and answers to questions.


[Turkshop](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/lab/turkshop/): 
Workshop on the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, introducing [turktools](turktools.net): a set of tools designed to assist researchers to create a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. The tools further help streamline the design of such linguistic experiment and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.

In the winter of 2015 I'll teach a special topics undergraduate seminar, topic TBD.
