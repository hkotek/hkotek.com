I am a Linguist working at Apple. My role involves improving Siri's Natural Language Understanding. Specifically, I lead Siri's NL Understanding Annotation projects. This includes contributing to Siri ontology development and design; leading Named Entity Recognition efforts; creating annotation guidelines and trainings; establishing metrics to measure annotator productivity, accuracy, and throughput; interfacing with data scientists and engineers to develop annotation projects; managing and setting project priorities to align with organization-wide milestones and guidelines; and coordinating with vendors and Finance.

Although I am not currently teaching at a university, I still accept some advising requests. If you are on this site for this reason, email me at the above address. 

I received my PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 2014, with a dissertation on the syntax, semantics, and processing of questions. Prior to joining Apple, I was a Lecturer in Semantics at Yale, a Visiting Assistant Professor in Syntax at NYU, and I have held a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at McGill University. My main research specialty is in understanding the cognitive constraints on the structure of human language, with the goal of developing an inventory of the tools available to the language faculty for the construction of natural language utterances and for their interpretation: What strategies are employed during structure building in the syntax? What additional machinery must the semantics provide in order to interpret these structures? How does this inventory vary cross-linguistically, and how does it manifest itself in online sentence processing? My research employs a variety of experimental techniques, supplemented by elicitation work and traditional judgment work. Some of my recent research topics include the syntax and semantics of *wh*-questions, Association with Focus, relative clauses, ellipsis, and comparative and superlative quantifiers.
