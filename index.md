About me
--------

I am a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/department-linguistics), working on the the syntax and semantics of questions. I recently graduated from the [Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/). [My dissertation](http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002231/current.pdf?_s=mFXst8rtWr5B1Rhc) proposes a new syntax-semantics for *wh*-questions, focusing mostly on English and German questions, and presenting evidence from offline judgments as well as online sentence processing.

Research interests
------------------

**Broad interests**: The syntax-semantics interface; Experimental approaches to syntax and semantics. 

**Narrow interests**: How movement and in-situ modes of composition affect Scope: 

* The syntax and semantics of questions
* Constraints on covert movement
* Derivational economy and derivational timing
* First language acquisition of syntax and semantics
* Experimental approaches to syntactic theory
* Degree semantics, comparatives, superlatives, and numerals
