I am a Linguist working at Apple. I am a member of the Natural Language data science team for Siri Understanding. I have expertise in managing all aspects of data collection and analysis efforts for various NLP tasks at scale, including onboarding and training annotators; designing annotation tasks and tools; data sampling; analyzing data for accuracy, consistency, and efficiency; error analysis; implementing improvements to ontology, task design, and annotator training; and reporting to stakeholders. Most recently, my focus has been on data generation, robustness, and safety of Large Language Models. In Fall 2023, I am teaching a [seminar on LLMs at MIT](https://linguistics.mit.edu/24-s90-special-topics_exploring_language_technologies/). 

I continue to engage in research as a Research Affiliate at [MIT linguistics](https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/hkotek/), with a focus on LLM safety and efficient data collection. My academic research focused on different aspects of the syntax-semantics interface, using both traditional and experimental methods. I mainly worked on A-bar phenomena, including wh-questions, focus constructions, relative clauses and free relatives, ellipsis, wh-indefinites, (focus) intervention effects, and comparatives and superlatives. I additionally have an ongoing interest in studying and contributing to equity in the field.

I received my PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 2014, with a dissertation on the syntax, semantics, and processing of questions. Prior to joining Apple, I was a Lecturer in Semantics at Yale and a Visiting Assistant Professor in Syntax at NYU, and I have held a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at McGill University.

✨ ️***NEW***✨  Blog 
-------------------

### Ethics ##

* [Text-to-image models are shallow in more ways than one (part 2)](/blog/text-to-image-models-ethics/): a discussion of interesting aspects of the images generated in [part 1](/blog/text-to-image-models-shallow-parsing/) with respect to gender, race and ethnicity, age, attractiveness, lexical choices, and image style. In short: the models exhibit biases along all these dimensions, in fairly predictable and yet concerning ways.

* [Text-to-image models are shallow in more ways than one (part 1)](/blog/text-to-image-models-shallow-parsing/): a summary of some basic experiments I carried out for my seminar on LLMs, focusing on syntactic and semantic ambiguity. We find that text-to-image models engage in very shallow parsing, likely not much more than a bag-of-words approach. Many sometimes-surprising frequency effects follow.

* [Stereotypical Gender Effects in 2016](/blog/stereotypical-gender-effects-in-2016/): a summary of a co-authored study I conducted in 2016 exploring stereotypes associated with occupation-denoting nouns. [Full dataset here (csv)](2016-gender-norming-results.csv)

* [Doctors can't get pregnant and other gender biases in ChatGPT](/blog/gender-bias-in-chatgpt/): a writeup of my [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/HadasKotek/status/1648453764117041152) that went viral, illustrating gender biases in ChatGPT.

### Informational posts on the non-academic job market ##

* [Job application materials](/blog/job-application-materials/): in this post I share two versions of my academic job application materials, one from my first post-PhD cycle and one from the last cycle. I also share the resume that got me my alt-ac job at the end of that last cycle. 

* [A guided self-reflection for getting started with Alt-Ac jobs](https://hkotek.com/blog/altac-guided-self-reflection/): a post with lots of questions you can ask yourself to start figuring out what jobs are right for you.

* [Job titles and job descriptions for linguists (and other social scientists)](/blog/altac-jobs-for-social-scientists/): a compilation of (a) job titles, (b) informal job descriptions, (c) sample job ads, and (d) interviews with job holders for a diverse set of non-technical roles for linguists. This post is over 5k words long and divided into 10 categories, since there's a lot to cover.  

* [Transferable skills (and how to talk about them)](/blog/altac-transferable_skills/): a compilation of transferable skills for AltAc jobs, including sample resume bullet points using my own experience in academia to illustrate.

* [Learning about Alt-Ac opportunities (aka how to get started)](/blog/altac-get-started-exploring-options/): on getting started on the journey by asking yourself some questions and gathering some information. 

* [Prepping for Alt-Ac jobs (aka taking action)](/blog/altac-get-started-doing-prep/): on getting started on the journey by taking some active steps to learn or expand relevant skills.

* [Alt-Ac informational interviews](/blog/altac-informational-interview-questions/): on informational interviews for alt-ac careers, including a suggested list of questions. 

* [Do you need a graduate degree to get an Alt-Ac job?](/blog/do-you-need-a-phd/): answering this FAQ. Short answer: probably not. 

* [Let's talk about terminology](/blog/altac-terminology/): an ongoing master list of industry terminology. 


### Academia ##

* [Job application materials](/blog/job-application-materials/): in this post I share two versions of my academic job application materials, one from my first post-PhD cycle and one from the last cycle. I also share the resume that got me my alt-ac job at the end of that last cycle. 

* [On the emotional toll of the academic job market](/blog/on-the-emotional-toll-of-the-academic-job-market/): a reflection on how emotionally difficult it was to be on the academic job market. 

* [My academic job market journey](/blog/my-academic-journey/): a short post about my own experience on the academic job market, mainly focusing on the numbers and concrete facts.

* [On leaving academia](https://hkotek.com/blog/on-leaving-academia/): a three-part post ([part 2](https://hkotek.com/blog/more-musings-on-leaving-academia/), [part 3](https://hkotek.com/blog/altac-benefits-of-working-in-tech/)) that gets a bit navel-gazy. 

* [Academic job interview questions](/blog/academic-job-interview-questions/): a compilation of 25 sets of interview questions I was asked in interviews between 2014--2019.
