About me
--------

I am a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at McGill University. I
recently graduated from the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at
MIT. [My dissertation](Kotek-dissertation.pdf) proposes a new
syntax-semantics for *wh*-questions, focusing mostly on English and
German questions, and presenting evidence from offline judgments as well
as online sentence processing.

Research interests
------------------

**Broad interests**: The syntax-semantics interface; Experimental approaches to syntax and semantics. 

**Narrow interests**: How movement and in-situ modes of composition affect Scope: 

* The syntax and semantics of questions
* Constraints on covert movement
* Derivational economy and derivational timing
* First language acquisition of syntax and semantics
* Experimental approaches to syntactic theory
* Degree semantics, comparatives, superlatives, and numerals
 
For an updated list of my presentations and publications, please consult
[my CV](KotekCV.pdf).

Manuscripts and current work
----------------------------

**(contact me for a copy of the papers)**

* Two kinds of single-pair readings. In preparation. I argue that there are two possible scenarios described in the literature as a "single-pair" reading of a multiple question, but that only one of the two is a true single-pair. The other, I argue, is in fact a special case of a pair-list reading. 

* What's her face. Submitted. A snippet discussing the properties of the construction *what's her face*. (with Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine)


Ongoing projects
----------------
* The syntax and semantics of multiple *wh*-questions in English.

* Intervention effects in *wh*-questions and focus constructions.

* The syntax and semantics of "also." 

* The syntax and semantics of "the same." (with Martin Hackl)

* Morphological blocking effects using ERPs (with Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine, Ayaka Sugawara, Shigeru Miyagawa, and Tohoku University Koizumi Lab)

 
Other

If you’re wondering how to pronounce my name: in IPA, my first name is [hə.'das] and my last name is ['ko.tɛk]. [Hadas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadass) is a Israeli/Jewish name referring to one of the Four species, and it is also related to the biblical name [Hadassah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther). Kotek is a Czech name meaning "kitten," and it has cognates in pretty much every Slavic language I know of. Most English-speakers will pronounce my last name with a dipthong, and that is fine with me - I often pronounce it like that myself these days. As for my first name, the only important thing to remember is the stress. You can get rid of the first syllable altogether and I'll still recognize what you say as my name, but if you stress the first syllable there's a good chance that won't even realize that you're talking to me. 

[Here](AvodatGmar.pdf) is a research paper I wrote about my grandfather's journey during World War II: from Czechoslovakia to Denmark to Sweden to England back to mainland Europe, and after the war: from Slovakia to Austria to France to Israel (in Hebrew; contains original interviews with 10 individuals who were also members of my grandfather's Youth Aliyah group, who had similar stories).
