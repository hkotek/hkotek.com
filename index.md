I am a Linguist working at Apple. I work on data science for natural language annotation projects for the Siri and Language Technologies team. This includes contributing to Siri ontology development and design; leading Named Entity Recognition efforts; co-coordinating and contributing to Data Science and Engineering around various Siri products; establishing metrics to measure annotator productivity, accuracy, and throughput; contributing to new task and tool development around data annotation; and coordinating with vendor project managers, annotators, and Annotation Operations admins.

I additionally continue to engage in research as a Research Affiliate at [MIT linguistics](https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/hkotek/). My research focuses on different aspects of the syntax-semantics interface, using both traditional and experimental methods. I mainly work on A-bar phenomena, including wh-questions, focus constructions, relative clauses and free relatives, ellipsis, wh-indefinites, (focus) intervention effects, and comparatives and superlatives. I additionally have an ongoing interest in studying and contributing to equity in the field.

I received my PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 2014, with a dissertation on the syntax, semantics, and processing of questions. Prior to joining Apple, I was a Lecturer in Semantics at Yale, a Visiting Assistant Professor in Syntax at NYU, and I have held a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at McGill University. 

Although I am not currently teaching at a university, I still accept some advising requests. If you are on this site for this reason, email me at the above address.
