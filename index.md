I am a lecturer in Semantics in the Linguistics Department. I received my PhD from MIT in 2014, and prior to joining Yale I held a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at McGill University. My main research specialty lies in generative syntax and its interaction with formal semantics. The goal of my research is to develop an understanding of the inventory of the tools available to the language faculty for the construction of natural language utterances and for their interpretation: What strategies are employed during structure building in the syntax? What additional machinery must the semantics provide in order to interpret these structures? How does this inventory vary cross-linguistically, and how does it manifest itself in online sentence processing? My research employs a variety of experimental techniques, supplemented by elicitation work and traditional judgment work. Some of my recent research topics include the syntax and semantics of *wh*-questions, Association with Focus, relative clauses, and comparative and superlative quantifiers.
