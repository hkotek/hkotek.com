About me
--------

I am a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/department-linguistics). I received my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics and Philosophy](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/) at MIT. [My dissertation](http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002231/current.pdf?_s=mFXst8rtWr5B1Rhc) proposes a new syntax-semantics for *wh*-questions, focusing mostly on English and German questions, and presenting evidence from offline judgments as well as online sentence processing. More recently, I have been expanding my work to the understudies languages Chuj (Mayan) and Tibetan. I have also been working on a new theory of intervention effects in *wh*-questions, and using them as a diagnostic of the underlying structure of questions, Association with Focus constructions, and relative clauses. To read more about these projects and others, visit my [research page](www.hkotek.com/research).

Research interests
------------------

**Broad interests**: The syntax-semantics interface; Experimental approaches to syntax and semantics. 

**Narrow interests**: How movement and in-situ modes of composition affect Scope: 

* The syntax and semantics of questions
* Constraints on covert movement
* Derivational economy and derivational timing
* First language acquisition of syntax and semantics
* Experimental approaches to syntactic theory
* Degree semantics, comparatives, superlatives, and numerals
