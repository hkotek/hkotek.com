My research concentrates different aspects of the syntax-semantics interface, using both traditional and experimental tools. This work can be divided into several different research questions.


English multiple *wh*-questions
-------------------------------
This project studies the syntax and semantics of English questions, using *focus intervention effects* as a diagnostic for the structural position of surface-in-situ *wh*-phrases. I argue for *covert movement* of in-situ *wh*-phrases in multiple English questions. Further evidence is provided from experimental data, to show that covert *wh*-movement, unlike overt *wh*-movement, often targets positions other than interrogative C. My dissertation expands on parts of this project, developing a new semantics for questions that can account for the data patterns I have discovered.

The syntax and semantics of *most*
----------------------------------
This project focuses on the syntax, semantics, and processing behavior of *most* in subject position. We argue that *most* is ambiguous between a *proportional* reading, which can be paraphrased as 'more than half,' and a *superlative* reading, which is usually associated with the determiner *the most*. Evidence comes from an array of experiments and from judgment data.

Understanding Hebrew questions 
------------------------------
This project concentrates on the syntax and semantics of Hebrew multiple questions. I argue that Hebrew syntax distinguishes two kinds of *wh*-phrases: those headed by a *wh*-element and those headed by another element. I furthermore investigate the possible meanings of such multiple questions.

The acquisition of covert movement
----------------------------------
This project concerns children's acquisition of covert movement. We concentrate on the phenomenon of Antecedent Contained Deletion (ACD) in English. We argue that children are able to perform both short and long-distance covert movement to correctly interpret ACD. We furthermore argue that around the age of 5;6, children acquire a 'Scope Matching Preference,' such that the size of movement in the sentence should correspond to the size of ellipsis in that sentence, with mismatches being perceived as sub-optimal.

Tools for online linguistic surveys
-----------------------------------
Together with [Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine](http://mitcho.com/academic/), we develop a set of free, open-source tools that aid in the construction of linguistic surveys for [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome), along with a supplied server-side component which allows researchers to host these randomized experiments on their own servers. The tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. These tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.

Tools available at: [turktools.net](turktools.net).

Morphological blocking effects in causative constructions
---------------------------------------------------------
A project studying the structure of causative constructions in English and Japanese and arguing for a decompositional approach, as in Distributed Morphology, and against a lexical approach where causatives are formed and stored in the lexicon.  Evidence comes from English judgment data and from English and Japanese experimental evidence from MEG and ERPs.

Automaticity in L2 language acquisition
---------------------------------------
A project studying the automaticity of speech perception in second language acquisition of Japanese by native speakers of English, using ERPs and MEG. We show that as little as one semester of classroom experience with Japanese enhances discrimination of a phonemic contrast not found in English, but that L2 speech processing is still less automatic than for L1 listeners. The project furthermore examines whether changes in performance are more strongly related to the number of contact classroom hours, or the intensity of hours, and shows that duration of study plays an important role.
