My research concentrates different aspects of the syntax-semantics interface, using both traditional and experimental tools. This work can be divided into several different (but related) research projects.


Operations in Grammar
---------------------
This work investigates the nature of (overt and covert) movement in natural language, how focus is calculated, and how the two interact. First, it is proposed that Association with Focus must involve covert focus movement with pied-piping. I additionally argue that the derivation of English *wh*-questions must involve both covert movement and focus-alternatives composition, and that the pattern and distribution of *intervention effects* in *wh*-questions suggests that syntactic derivations are better understood as constructed top-down, left-to-right, rather than bottom-up. Finally, I argue that intervention effects are the logical consequence of the inability of movement and focus to operate over the same structures, leading to the (correct) expectation that they are in fact quite a prevalent phenomenon which can be found in a variety of linguistic structures.

Non-interrogative uses of *wh*-words
------------------------------------
Aside from their canonical interrogative use, *wh*-words in many languages are used to express a variety of quantificational expressions, including free relatives, NPIs, *wh*-quantification, and free choice items. A key question is what syntactic and semantic strategies are employed to quantify over the alternatives introduced by *wh*-words. To answer this question, this project studies a number of non-interrogative *wh*-constructions through original elicitation on Chuj (Mayan; Guatemala) and Dharamsala Tibetan (India).

Intervention effects
--------------------
This work investigates the nature of *intervention effects* in A-bar constructions. It is shown that intervention can be used as a diagnostic of underlying syntactic structures, in particular distinguishing between regions where focus-alternatives are computed and areas where covert movement has occurred. This diagnostic informs our understanding of a variety of A-bar and pied-piping phenomena in *wh*-questions, Association with Focus constructions, and relative clauses.

The syntax/semantics of *wh*-questions
--------------------------------------
This work studies the syntax and semantics of *wh*-questions, concentrating on English and German multiple questions. I argue for *covert scrambling* of in-situ *wh*-phrases in English multiple questions, parallel to the overt scrambling of *wh*-in-situ in German. Evidence is provided from experimental data as well as offline judgments. My dissertation develops a new semantic framework for questions building on the syntax that I motivate. I am currently writing an LI Monograph based on this work.

Scope restrictions in sluicing and ellipsis licensing
-----------------------------------------------------
In joint work with [Matt Barros](https://sites.google.com/view/mattbarros/home), we defend a semantic identity account of ellipsis licensing.  We notice a surprising asymmetry in sluicing constructions with quantified antecedents, where surface-scope antecedents can license a multiple sluice, but inverse-scope antecedents cannot. We argue that this finding is explained by semantic accounts of ellipsis licensing, where ellipsis is licensed when the sluice corresponds to an (implicit) Question under Discussion. We show that QuDs cannot be computed based on the truth-conditional content of the antecedents alone; instead, they must be computed only after (scalar) implicatures have been calculated and added to the common ground, along with the context of utterance. We additionally examine the commitments required of a syntactic LF-identity account of ellipsis licensing in order to account for multiple sluicing with quantified antecedents, and argue that accounts along these lines would run into serious trouble, making them practically untenable.

Tools for online linguistic surveys
-----------------------------------
Together with [Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine](http://mitcho.com/academic/), we develop a set of free, open-source tools that aid in the construction of linguistic surveys for [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome), along with a supplied server-side component which allows researchers to host these randomized experiments on their own servers. The tools allow for the creation of a wide range of linguistic tasks, including linguistic grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, and picture-matching tasks. These tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data.

Tools available at: [turktools.net](http://turktools.net).

The syntax and semantics of *most*
----------------------------------
This work focuses on the syntax, semantics, and processing behavior of *most* in subject position. We argue that *most* is ambiguous between a *proportional* reading, which can be paraphrased as 'more than half,' and a *superlative* reading, which is usually associated with the determiner *the most*. Evidence comes from an array of experiments and from judgment data.

Understanding Hebrew questions 
------------------------------
This work concentrates on the syntax and semantics of Hebrew questions. I argue that Hebrew syntax distinguishes two kinds of *wh*-phrases: those headed by a *wh*-element and those headed by another element. I furthermore investigate the possible meaning multiple questions in Hebrew.

The acquisition of covert movement
----------------------------------
This work concerns children's acquisition of covert movement. We concentrate on the phenomenon of Antecedent Contained Deletion (ACD) in English. We argue that children are able to perform both short and long-distance covert movement to correctly interpret ACD. We furthermore argue that around the age of 5;6, children acquire a 'Scope Matching Preference,' such that the size of movement in the sentence should correspond to the size of ellipsis in that sentence, with mismatches being perceived as sub-optimal.

Morphological blocking effects in causative constructions
---------------------------------------------------------
A project studying the structure of causative constructions in English and Japanese and arguing for a decompositional approach, as in Distributed Morphology, and against a lexical approach where causatives are formed and stored in the lexicon.  Evidence comes from English judgment data and from English and Japanese experimental evidence from MEG and ERPs.

Automaticity in L2 language acquisition
---------------------------------------
A project studying the automaticity of speech perception in second language acquisition of Japanese by native speakers of English, using ERPs and MEG. We show that as little as one semester of classroom experience with Japanese enhances discrimination of a phonemic contrast not found in English, but that L2 speech processing is still less automatic than for L1 listeners. The project furthermore examines whether changes in performance are more strongly related to the number of contact classroom hours, or the intensity of hours, and shows that duration of study plays an important role.
