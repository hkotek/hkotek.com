Research interests
------------------

I am a syntactician and a semanticist. I am also an experimentalist and a fieldworker. The big questions that interest me are about the architecture of grammar: how and when is meaning computed during structure building in the syntax? How much additional machinery must the semantics provide? How should we diagnose and theorize about scope-taking operations in the different components of grammar? 

My research uses a variety of experimental techniques, including sentence processing, large-scale grammaticality surveys, sentence completion tasks, picture-matching tasks, first language acquisition, and ERPs. Alongside experimentation, my work draws on traditional judgment data and fieldwork, concentrating most recently on Chuj (Mayan) and Tibetan, as well as English, Hebrew, and German. Some of my recent research topics include:

* Questions
* Focus 
* Pied-piping 
* Intervention effects
* Relative clauses and free relatives
* Expletive negation and -ever relatives
* Derivational economy and derivational timing
* Additivity
* Comparative and superlative quantifiers

You can find papers on these and other topics on the [publications page](www.hkotek.com/publications). To read more about each project, visit the [research page](www.hkotek.com/research).

Academic history
----------------

I am currently a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/department-linguistics), where my supervisor is [Junko Shimoyama](https://sites.google.com/site/junkoshimoyama/). 

I received my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/) in 2014, where I wrote [a dissertation](http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002231/current.pdf?_s=mFXst8rtWr5B1Rhc) on the syntax and semantics of *wh*-questions. My dissertation committee included [Danny Fox](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/fox/index.html) and [Irene Heim](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/heim/), alongside co-chairs [Martin Hackl](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/) and [David Pesetsky](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/). 

Before starting my PhD, I was a visiting student at the [Humboldt University in Berlin](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en), and had a visiting position at [ZAS](http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/), working with [Manfred Krifka](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de/institut/professuren/sprachwissenschaft/mitarbeiter/krifka) and [Hans-Martin GÃ¤rtner](http://www.nytud.mta.hu/depts/tlp/gaertner/publist.html). I also spent one year as a Masters student at Tel-Aviv University, where I was supervised by [Nirit Kadmon](http://humanities.tau.ac.il/segel/kadmon/) and had a research assistantship with [Alexander Grosu](http://www.tau.ac.il/~grosua/). Still further back, I received a BA in Linguistics and Political Science from Tel-Aviv University.
