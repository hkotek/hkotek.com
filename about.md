Research interests
------------------

I am a syntactician and a semanticist. I am also an experimentalist, and have worked on several understudied languages. The goal of my research is to develop an understanding of the inventory of the tools available to the language faculty: What strategies are employed during structure building in the syntax? What additional machinery must the semantics provide in order to interpret these structures? How does this inventory vary cross-linguistically, and how does it manifest itself in online processing?

My research uses a variety of experimental techniques, including sentence processing, large-scale grammaticality surveys, first language acquisition, and ERPs. Alongside experimentation, my work draws on traditional judgment data and elicitations, concentrating most recently on Chuj (Mayan) and Tibetan, as well as English, Hebrew, and German. Some of my recent research topics include:

* *Wh*-indeterminates, including *wh*-questions, indefinites, NPIs, and *wh*-quantification
* Relative clauses and free relatives
* Association with Focus 
* Focus intervention effects
* Pied-piping 
* Sluicing and VP-ellipsis
* Derivational economy and derivational timing
* Questions under Discussion
* Additivity
* Comparative and superlative quantifiers

Academic history
----------------

I am currently a Lecturer in Semantics at the [Yale University Department of Linguistics](http://ling.yale.edu/). I was previously a Visiting Assistant Professor in Syntax at [NYU Department of Linguistics](http://as.nyu.edu/linguistics.html), and I have also held a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/department-linguistics), where my supervisor was [Junko Shimoyama](https://sites.google.com/site/junkoshimoyama/). 

I received my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/) in 2014, where I wrote [a dissertation](http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002231/current.pdf?_s=mFXst8rtWr5B1Rhc) on the syntax and semantics of *wh*-questions. My dissertation was co-chaired by [Danny Fox](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/fox/index.html), [Martin Hackl](http://web.mit.edu/hackl/www/), [Irene Heim](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/heim/), and [David Pesetsky](http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/). 

Before starting my PhD, I was a visiting student at the [Humboldt University in Berlin](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en), and had a visiting position at [ZAS](http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/), working with [Manfred Krifka](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/de/institut/professuren/sprachwissenschaft/mitarbeiter/krifka) and [Hans-Martin GÃ¤rtner](http://www.nytud.mta.hu/depts/tlp/gaertner/publist.html). I also spent one year as a Masters student at [Tel-Aviv University](https://humanities.tau.ac.il/linguistics_eng/), where I was supervised by [Nirit Kadmon](http://humanities.tau.ac.il/segel/kadmon/) and had a research assistantship with [Alexander Grosu](http://www.tau.ac.il/~grosua/). Still further back, I received a BA in Linguistics and Political Science from Tel-Aviv University.
