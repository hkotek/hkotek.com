# Informational interview questions

As part of a *careers for linguists* workshop I've been teaching, we have developed a long set of questions I will reproduce below. We tweak the questions and pick just a subset every time we host an external speaker, to match the speaker's background and experience. I've organized these questions by topic. This post is part of [a longer blog post about informational interviews](https://hkotek.com/blog/altac-informational-interview-questions/), created for ease of saving and printing.
