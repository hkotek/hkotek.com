As I've been collecting the various [**lists of interview questions I've participated in**](/academic-interview-questions), I can't help but also add a few words about the process itself. There is more to say than can and should fit in one post, but there are at least some things I can say. 

# By the numbers

I went on the job market for **6 cycles** between 2014--2019. 

Over the years, I had **11 different letter writers**, to whom I continue to be eternally grateful. 

I applied to **109 jobs** (mostly TT but some temporary, quite selectively). I had **29 long-list interviews** and **12 short-list interviews**. I received 1 TT job offer which didn't pan out (and is a very long and shocking story indeed) and 1 unsolicited offer (which I also didn't take mainly because of the job's location), plus 4 offers for temporary jobs. So overall you might argue I did alright. 

I became quite immersed in the gossip and most of the time knew the makeup of the entire short-list for each job I was short-listed for. Over 12 distinct short-lists, with an average of 4-5 candidates per list, there were only **three(!) other distinct female candidates**, who showed up in lists again and again. I was the only female candidate on at least a half dozen lists. In total, those lists contained roughly 35 men, though I may be off by 1-2 on that. I cannot begin to explain how demoralizing it was when I started to realize this pattern and [**its implications**](https://hbr.org/2016/04/if-theres-only-one-woman-in-your-candidate-pool-theres-statistically-no-chance-shell-be-hired). 

# By contrast

I know the exact date I decided to actually act on my increasing desire to leave academia. It was the day I got the rejection from the only job I was short-listed for that I was really interested in 2019. It was March 4. 

Between March and May of 2019 I went on two full job application cycles, from submission to phone interviews to on-sites, and ended up with three offers. I accepted one of them, moved to the Bay Area, and started the job in July of 2019. It was such a stark contrast with the experience I had in academia. 


# In reality

I had at least one short-list interview every year. I was told I was the second choice on multiple occasions. I don't know if it was true or just a way to make me feel better, and I don't really care; it did make me feel better so I'm going to keep believing it. I was also told repeatedly that it was just a matter of time -- getting the exact right job search at the exact right time (and with the exact right search committee, I might add). Maybe that's true, we'll never know. 

But the job search was also a soul-crushing process that I did not enjoy even a little bit.

The one thing you know when you enter a temporary position is that where you are at is *not* where you'll be next year (or in 2 years, or whatever). You usually start applying to leave within a month or two of arriving. Each new place comes with new people, new regulations, new course management software, new bus routes, cafes, hangouts, and hopefully friends. It also comes with new course preps and almost always *without* funding to support any research or travel. With time, it became impossible to sustain experimental research or really anything that wasn't fully theoretical. This, too, takes a toll. How do you get established as a whole person in a place where by definition you can't set roots and you can't even fully do the research you want to be doing? 
 
There is *so much* politics and *so much* luck that goes into the job search process. There are jobs that I've been told (in confidence) I didn't get because one particular member of the department or search committee (and once, of the community beyond the department) had a grudge against one of my advisors, and that fact cost me the offer. I appreciate knowing this insight and I'm grateful to committee members who shared the feedback, especially early on when it helped me improve my interview skills and calibrate my expectations. There were also some jobs where post- (or, to be honest, mid-) interview it because clear that I wasn't a good fit for the job, and that was ok too. I obviously didn't expect to get every job I applied for, and understand that there are a lot of considerations that go into choosing the right candidate. 

At the same time,  the amount of power some senior members of the community wield, and the ease with which they use it to destroy junior members' careers in a bid to get back at a disliked rival -- and I do not think I am exaggerating here -- is mind boggling. I can count multiple instances where this happened to me. I do believe that is unusual, but most people who've been at this long enough can recount some such stories themselves. 

I should also say that I am immensely grateful to the broad community I discovered had my back when some of these nasty instances were taking place. Those are the people who kept me alive, quite literally, and I am forever in their debt.
