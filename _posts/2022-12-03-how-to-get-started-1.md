Ok, so you've decided you want to explore non-academic jobs, but you don't know what options are out there and you don't know how to begin prepping. This post is an attempt to spell out some of the steps you'll need to go through. This is part 1 in a two-part series. I'll cover learning steps first, and the next post will discuss actions you can take. 
  

## Initial phase: learn the basics

It can be daunting to start pivoting to a non-academic career. Most academics share the experience of having been trained to stay on the academic path, and many are explicitly or implicitly taught that anything else is failure or quitting. Putting aside the many fallacies there, there is one thing to be said for the academic path: it's very clear --- your goal is to obtain that coveted tenure-track assistant professor position, and once you have it your goal is to get tenured, i.e. become and associate professor, and maybe one day, a full professor.[^1] It's clear how what you've done in grad school and as a precariously employed academic constitute relevant experience for the job, and your advisors have direct knowledge that can help you apply for it. 

Not so once you start looking outside this narrow path. It can be hard to see how your skills are relevant to other jobs (although they absolutely are!). It can be hard to even know what jobs are available, what they're called, or where to look for them. Your advisors can't help you because they don't know. Maybe you're even afraid to ask, worried that they'll think less of you or stop investing time in advising you. So there is a great deal that you'll have to research and teach yourself. 


### Spend a bit of time understanding yourself better 

An ideal job would sit at the intersection of: 

* Things that you are good at
* Things that you enjoy doing 
* Things that the market needs and compensates for

Discovering those things can be a prolonged process of **self-exploration**. Some questions to ask yourself: 

* Do you want a job where you have a lot of meetings and collaborations or where you mostly work on your own? 
* Do you want to go deep into one topic or engage with a lot of topics in less detail? 
* Do you enjoy your research? What about it is enjoyable -- is it identifying resources, or building the early proposal that gets you close to the solution, or trouble-shooting/identifying holes in an early proposal, or doing the right statistical analysis, or producing the graphs and other visualization, or writing the project up, or presenting it, ...? 
* Do you enjoy science communication? If so, what parts? Is it writing long-form papers, or making posters or slides, or writing blog posts, or answering questions in forums or groups or other informal venues, or working with large/small groups, or teaching one-time workshops, ...?
* Do you enjoy teaching? In academia teaching isn't always the most valued part of the job, but if you enjoy it, maybe consider making that a part of your new career. What part(s) of teaching do you enjoy? Is it making teaching materials, deciding on the curriculum, standing in front of a classroom, working in small groups or large, doing hands-on activities, giving office hours, focusing on the right assessment tools, or providing good feedback, ...? 
* Do you enjoy organizing things? Again, this type of service may not be appreciated in academia but there are whole jobs that revolve around making sure things are working smoothly. Do you enjoy coordinating the work of multiple individuals, or finding new resources, or administering budgets, or hiring people, or finding the right tool for the job, or making connections across parts of your organization that don't always speak to each other? 
* Do you want to work on the ideation and early design of a product, on implementing someone else's design, on testing a product with customers, on selling it, on researching market reception, or communicating about it, ...? 
* Do you enjoy designing things? both in terms of process and in terms of visual impact? 

That is, it's useful to recognize that the three main components of an academic life --- research, teaching, and service --- really break down into many smaller pieces. When you say you enjoy "research", for example, what about it is actually fun and what is just the stuff that comes along with it? There will be jobs that cater to any particular part of your interests that minimize the stuff you enjoy less. 

To identify particular **skills** that you enjoy and are good at more directly, if the questions above are still too vague or hard for you to think through, there are various tests online that can help you identify skills more explicitly. Google one that works for you, go to your university's career center for resources, or consider coaching or other outside help if necessary. 

I frequently get asked, **do you have to know how to code in order to get a job in tech**? The true answer is *it depends!* If you want to be a software engineer, then yes, you'll have to code. But there are plenty of jobs that require minimal or no coding experience. Even if you *can* code, if you don't enjoy it, a coding-heavy job is probably not for you. What *is* true, though, is that more jobs will be open to you if you can code at least a little bit, and that often more technical jobs are better compensated than those that do not require technical skills.

This is also a good time to think about your **values and preferences**. For example:  

* Are there types of companies, industries, or jobs you wouldn't want to do? Some common examples may include working for the government in certain capacities or working for certain companies whose products you may not support. 
* Are there locations you do/don't want to live in?

Finally, you should also ask yourself: **do you want a job related to your academic field of studies**? That's not necessarily a given, and even if you say yes, there are different levels of engagement with the topic that might work for you. For a linguist, do you care if the product you work on is language-related, or that the job itself is language-related (those are not the same!)? Do you want to engage with language data directly or would you be happy doing more of a higher-level analysis where you don't usually engage with the raw data itself? 

### Learn about different jobs and industries

There are various materials out there that can help you identify types of jobs, including guides and interview series. [This post](https://www.khiajohnson.com/post/2022/getting-a-start-in-tech/) by Khia Johnson provides a collection of links to get started. The main link from there I'd like to point out is Superlinguoâ€™s [Linguist Job Interviews](https://www.superlinguo.com/post/173873032222/superlinguo-linguist-job-interviews-full-list), which gives a lot of variety. I'll also have a post of my own soon, and I'll update this sentence here when it's up. 

The process of learning about different types of jobs can also help you answer some of the questions above. When you read about people's descriptions of their jobs, are there parts that you relate to more? Which parts stand out repeatedly in different posts? Those are probably worth exploring more.

This is also a time to consider what type of employer you'd want to work for (and what type you would not!). Consider roughly four options:  

* Start-up/small company --- companies that have a very small number of employees (think several dozen). Job responsibilities are not well defined, so you'll have more flexibility, but there's probably less support if you get stuck. There may be fewer established processes in place (think small/no HR, for example). On the practical side, startups may pay less and be less inclined to support visas. But if you get in early and you believe in the product, if the company succeeds you may leave with a lot of reward in the form of actualized options. 
* Mid-sized company --- companies with a few dozen to a thousand employees, say. Such companies may have a few locations and may have been around for a bit longer. They're maybe not actively in a money raising phase, but rather have a stable product they produce. These companies will have less of a hierarchical structure, but still there are established teams and administrative processes and some documented knowledge. There could be interesting options for career growth here; a lot will depend on the individuals around you.
* The giants --- tech giants, financial institutions, large pharma companies, and the like. These are global companies with multiple offices worldwide and thousands and employees. They tend to be very stable and have established admin processes. They may be the most likely to support a visa application if you are international. Your role will often be very well defined, and there will likely be a decent level of structure and hierarchy. 
* Work for yourself --- there is always also the option of starting your own company or working as a consultant/freelance. This may be hard to do as a first job, but keep in mind that this is an option that may suit your personality and priorities down the line, once you've made the transition out of academia and gained a bit of experience.
