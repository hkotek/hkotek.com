Between 2014 and 2019 I went on the North American academic job market for 6(!) cycles. I applied broadly to jobs in theoretical syntax and semantics, experimental/psycholinguistics, SLACs as well as research institutions. I also applied to a handful of jobs in Europe and the UK. I had quite a bit of success, including one offer that eventually didn't pan out (and could be the subject of a whole entire other post, or series of posts more likely). 

Me being me, I took contemporaneous notes from the majority of interviews I did. I've been sitting on them for years and I've finally decided I should just put them out there for others to use. The academic job market is an absolute horror show (again, the topic of another post), and if this can help at least *someone* not feel so overwhelmed, I will count that as a great success.
